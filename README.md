# PowerBi_dashboard_project

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to understand who is leaving the bank and what patterns show up behind churn. The report covers 10,000 customers and highlights an overall churn rate of 20.37%.

What I built

KPI cards + gauge to track churn at a glance

Customer breakdown by gender, activity status, credit card ownership, country, and products

Combo visuals to compare customer volume vs churn rate by:

Age group

Credit score bands

Account balance ranges

Slicer-based filtering for quick exploration

Key insights (from the dashboard)

Customer base is concentrated in France (~50%), with Germany & Spain making up the rest.

Churn spikes are visible around the 51–60 age group.

Very low credit scores (≤400) show noticeably higher churn behaviour.

Churn rises in certain balance bands (notably 1k–10k and >200k).

Tools/Skills: Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Data Modelling, KPI Design, Customer Analytics, Data Visualisation
